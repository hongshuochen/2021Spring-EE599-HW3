## Question 3 (20 Points. Easy)

Given a vector of integer *input*, and an integer *sum*, return a set of sets {a,b}, where a,b are in the input vector and a+b = sum, which are the numbers in *input* such that they can add up to sum. Function is defined as ```std::set<std::set<int>> twoSum(std::vector<int>& input, int sum)```

- you can assume the vector input doesn't contain duplicated numbers.
- you can only use numbers in vector once.
- if there is no answer, the output should return an empty set.
- you should return **all** results in the input vector if there are multiple answers.
- **Hint**: you may try unordered_map.
- Examples:

  - input = {2,3,4,5}, sum = 7, output = {{2,5},{3,4}}
  - input = {2,3,-2,5,0}, sum = 0, output = {{2,-2}}
  - input = {1,5,4,10}, sum = 200, output = {}

## Question 4 (20 Points. Easy)

Write 2 classes to practice how to use the constructor, copy constructor, copy assign operator and destructor and compare the deep copy with shallow copy.

Both of the Student_shallow and Student_deep has one member integer pointer id.

- Student_shallow
  - Write a **default constructor** to allocate and initialize id to **nullptr**
  - Write a **parameterized constructor** to initialize id

- Student_deep
  - Write a **default constructor** to allocate and initialize id to **nullptr**
  - Write a **parameterized constructor** to initialize id
  - Write a **destructor** to print "Delete Student_deep!" and delete the integer pointer
  - Write a **copy constructor** with **deep copy**
  - Write a **copy assignment operator** with **deep copy**

```c++
class Student_shallow
{
public:
    int* id;
    Student_shallow();
    Student_shallow(int);
};
class Student_deep
{
public:
    int* id;
    Student_deep();
    Student_deep(int);
    ~Student_deep();
    Student_deep(const Student_deep&);
    Student_deep& operator=(const Student_deep&);
};
```

Eaxmple:
```
Student_shallow a;
Student_shallow b = a;
Student_shallow c;
c = a;
cout << *a.id << *b.id << *c.id << endl;
*c.id = 1;
cout << *a.id << *b.id << *c.id << endl;

Student_deep a;
Student_deep b = a;
Student_deep c;
c = a;
cout << *a.id << *b.id << *c.id << endl;
*c.id = 1;
cout << *a.id << *b.id << *c.id << endl;
```
Exepcted output:
```
000
111
000
001
Delete Student_deep!
Delete Student_deep!
Delete Student_deep!
```

Write several tests using GTest for your function in [tests/q4student_test.cc](tests/q4_student_test.cc).

Please create your test cases and run the following command to verify the functionality of your program. You don't need to test the destructor.
```
bazel test tests:q4_student_test
```

## Question 5 (20 Points. Medium)
Write a class to implement how complex number works in mathematics. A complex number can be expressed 
as **a+bi**, where a and b are real numbers. You are given an incomplete class `Complex`:
```c++
class Complex{
 public:

  Complex():real(0), ima(0){};
  ~Complex();
  float real;
  float ima;
```
Tasks:
1. implement a constructor that takes the initial real and imaginary number as 2 parameters.
2. implement a copy constructor.
3. implement a copy assignment operator.
4. the class will support '++' (as postfix) and '--' (as prefix) operators.
  - `complex++` should increase the real part by 1. 
  - `--complex` should decrease the real part by 1.
    - Example: `c=Complex(1,2); c++;`, *c=2+2i*
    - Example: `c=Complex(1,2); --c;`, *c=0+2i*
5. The class will support '>' operator, which returns boolean data. To compare two complex numbers x= a + bi and y=c+dj, for x > y should return true if  SQRT(a^2 + b^2) > SQRT(c^2 + d^2) 
Example: (1+2i) > (0+3i) = (1^2+2^2) > (0^2 + 3^2) = 5 > 9 = false.
6. the class will support '*' operator, which multiplies a real number:
  - the function returns a Complex object, which is multiplied both the real and imaginary parts.
    - Example: `c=Complex(1,2); d=Complex(); d=c*2;`, *d=2+4i*
7. the class will support '+=' operator on either float number and Complex object:
  - data type before '+=' must be a Complex object.
    - Example: `c=Complex(1,2); d=Complex(3,4); c+=d;`, *c=4+6i*
    - Example: `c=Complex(1,2); float d=2; c+=d;`, *c=3+2i*


Write a test using GTest for your finction in [tests/q5_student_test.cc](tests/q5_student_test.cc).
```
bazel test tests:q5_student_test
```

## Question 6 (20 Points. Medium)
Given an expression string, find if the input has valid brackets (i.e. { } or [ ] or ( ) ). Function is defined as ```bool‚Äã ‚ÄãCheckValidExpression‚Äã(‚Äãconst‚Äã ‚Äãstring‚Äã&‚Äã ‚Äãa‚Äã)```

An input expression is valid if:

Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
An empty string is also considered valid.

You should only check for the validity of brackets based on the above rules, i.e. ‚Äò(‚Äò, ‚Äò)‚Äô, ‚Äò[‚Äò, ‚Äò]‚Äô, ‚Äò{‚Äò, ‚Äò}‚Äô, not the rest of the expression.

üëâHint: Iterate the input from beginning to end and use a std:stack.

Example 1:
Input: "(a+b)"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: "(a+b)[c*d]{5g+h}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: "(a+b]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: "(7h+[5c)+7]"
Output: false

Example 5:
Input: "{2k+[5j]}"
Output: true

Example 6:
Input: "{2k++[5--*j]}"
Output: true

Write a test using GTest for your finction in [tests/q6_student_test.cc](tests/q6_student_test.cc).
```
bazel test tests:q6_student_test
```
Please compute the time complexity of your implementation.

Answer:
## Optional Question

The goal of this section is to introduce you to more challenging questions and some common problems in coding and algorithms.

- These questions don‚Äôt have any credits.
- We may not provide complete solutions or grading for them.
- Solving them is completely optional.

## Optional Question 1 (Easy)

- Write a function that prints all items in a std::stack. After the print, the items in the stack should remain the same.
- Write a function that prints all items in a std::queue. After the print, the items in the queue should remain the same.

## Optional Question 2 (Medium)

For the SinglyLinkedList class that you designed earlier, Implement this function:

```c++
bool DetectCycle();
```

This returns a true if it detects the linked list has a cycle. The cycle happens when the last item‚Äôs is pointing to a node inside the list rather than nullptr.

To create linked lists with cycles, use this constructor with i > 0 as described in SinglyLinkedList class above:

```c++
SinglyLinkedList(const std::vector<int> &inputs, int i)
```

Example 1:\
Input: inputs = [3,2,0,-4], i = 1\
Output: true\
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

![](img/1.png)

Example 2:\
Input: inputs = [1,2], i = 0\
Output: true\
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

![](img/2.png)

Example 3:\
Input: inputs = [1], i = -1\
Output: false\
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

![](img/3.png)

## Optional Question 3 (Medium)

For the SinglyLinkedList class, Implement the following function:
```
void erase(ListNode* p);
```
Where p is a pointer to a node that we want to erase. Your implementation should be O(1).

## Optional Question 4 (Medium)

Add two more variables to the SinglyLinkedList class:
- size_: which tracks the size of the list.
- tail_: which always points to the last item in the list if the list doesn‚Äôt have a cycle, otherwise, its value is nullptr.

How do each of these change the runtime of the class methods?

## Optional Question 5 (Medium)

Convert the SinglyLinkedList class to DoublyLinkedList class, where each node points to both its next and previous nodes. How would this change the runtime of the class methods?

## Optional Question 6 (Medium)

Write a program that takes a vector as a parameter, prints it, and then depending upon the user input, it performs various operations on a vector using an iterator and iterator functions.

- Your code should have a variable to track the current location which will be pointing at the first element of the vector as soon as you start execution of your code and changes as the program runs.
- You should print a menu to the user to perform the following operations.

Example input vector: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]

Menu:

1. What is the first element?

Once this is selected, the first element should be printed and the current location should be set to the first element.

2. What is the last element?

Once this is selected, the last element should be printed and the current location should be set to the last element.

3. What is the current element?

This should print the value at the current location. See examples below.

4. What is the i(th) element from the current location?

Once this is selected, the code should print the value at the current location.

If the value of i is negative then you should prompt an appropriate message to the user and should prompt the menu options again. (Eg: ‚ÄúValue of i cannot be negative‚Äù)

If the value of i is greater than the size of your vector then you should prompt an appropriate message to the user and should prompt the menu options again. (Eg: ‚ÄúValue of i cannot be greater than the size of vector‚Äù)
5. Exit.

- Your code should do this until the user enters ‚Äú5‚Äù, which is ‚ÄúExit‚Äù. When the user selects 5 you should print ‚ÄúExit!‚Äù and end the execution.
- GTests are NOT required for this question.
- Submit your code, along with a sample text file of the output for this input vector:
  - [1, 4, 5, 23, 100, 12, 18, 175]
  - Assume the user selections from the menu are: 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, (4,2), 5
